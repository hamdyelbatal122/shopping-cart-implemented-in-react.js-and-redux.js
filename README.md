# react.js shopping cart

example of shopping cart implemented in react.js and redux.js

for demo [click here](https://github.com/hamdyelbatal/shopping-cart-implemented-in-react.js-redux.js-)

## getting started

install dependencies and start local dev server

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## details
- build with [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Check their page for more details.
- this example is using redux.js for application state management, to learn more about it I recommend [this tutorial](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux).
- you can look under the hood directly from your browser using [redux devtools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension). Install extension for your browser, open demo page (link above) and see how app state changes when you interact with it.
- if you wonder why reducers, actions and selectors are all in one file inside folder called `ducks`, [read more here](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).

## TODO
- add reducers and selectors unit tests
